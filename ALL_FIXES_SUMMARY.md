# Summary of All Fixes Applied

## 1. Camera Import Issue (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Python was importing `camera/` directory instead of `camera.py` file
- **Solution**: Used `importlib.util` to explicitly load camera.py by path 
- **File**: `/unlook/client/scanner.py`

## 2. CompressionFormat Enum Issue (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Code tried to access `.value` attribute on string when fallback classes were used
- **Solution**: Added checks for `hasattr(format, 'value')` before accessing
- **Files**: `/unlook/client/camera.py` (capture and capture_multi methods)

## 3. MessageType Enum Issue (FIXED)
- **Problem**: `Message.to_dict()` tried to access `.value` on string message types
- **Solution**: Added check for `hasattr(self.msg_type, 'value')`
- **File**: `/unlook/core/protocol.py`

## 4. Missing Camera ID Parameter (FIXED)
- **Problem**: `set_exposure()` called without required camera_id parameter
- **Solution**: Get stereo pair IDs first, then call for each camera
- **File**: `/unlook/client/scanning/static_scanner.py`

## 5. Non-existent set_gain Method (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Code tried to call non-existent `set_gain()` method
- **Solution**: Removed calls; gain is set via set_exposure parameter
- **File**: `/unlook/client/scanning/static_scanner.py`

## 6. Missing deserialize_binary_message Fallback (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Function not defined when core imports fail
- **Solution**: Added fallback implementation for ULMC format
- **File**: `/unlook/client/camera.py`

## Current Status
✓ Camera import works correctly
✓ Enum/string handling is robust
✓ Camera methods called with proper parameters  
✓ Binary message deserialization has fallback
✓ Images are captured successfully

## Remaining Issue from Log
The scanner is capturing images but finding 0 correspondences for 3D reconstruction. This appears to be a pattern decoding issue, not related to the import/enum fixes.

```
INFO - Using 0 correspondences from decode_patterns
ERROR - No valid correspondences found
WARNING - No valid point cloud was generated.
```

This is a separate issue with the pattern decoder, not the fixes we implemented.

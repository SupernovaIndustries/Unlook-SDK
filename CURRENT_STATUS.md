# Current Scanner Status

## What's Working ✅
1. Camera import issue resolved using importlib
2. Enum/string handling works for both MessageType and CompressionFormat
3. Camera methods called with proper parameters (camera_id)
4. Binary message deserialization has working fallback
5. Images are being captured successfully
6. Pattern projection is working
7. Scanner connects and communicates properly

## What's Not Working ❌
1. Pattern correspondence detection: "Using 0 correspondences from decode_patterns"
2. No point cloud is generated

## Analysis of Log

### Successful Operations
- Scanner discovery and connection
- Camera configuration (exposure, gain)
- Pattern generation (maze patterns)
- Pattern projection and image capture
- Image rectification

### Current Issue
The scanner captures images but fails to find correspondences between the maze patterns:
```
INFO - Using enhanced pattern processor for low-contrast patterns...
INFO - Using 0 correspondences from decode_patterns
ERROR - No valid correspondences found
WARNING - No valid point cloud was generated.
```

This is not an import or enum issue - it's a pattern decoding problem. The maze patterns are being projected as checkerboards (due to projector limitations), but the decoder isn't finding matches between left and right images.

## Root Cause
The issue appears to be that:
1. The DLP projector can only project basic patterns (checkerboard)
2. The maze patterns are approximated as checkerboards
3. The pattern decoder expects actual maze patterns
4. No correspondences are found between the approximated patterns

## Next Steps (Not Part of Current Fix)
This would require either:
1. Using patterns the projector supports natively (phase shift, gray code)
2. Fixing the pattern decoder to work with approximated patterns
3. Implementing better maze-to-checkerboard conversion

The import and enum fixes are complete and working correctly.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+ (Python 3.9 or 3.10 recommended)
- Raspberry Pi (for server) with Raspberry Pi OS
- Unlook scanner modules (structured light, depth sensor, etc.)

### Basic Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SupernovaIndustries/unlook.git
cd unlook

# Basic installation with required dependencies
pip install -r client-requirements.txt
```

For detailed installation instructions, see [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md).

### GPU Acceleration Setup

For optimal performance, we recommend setting up GPU acceleration:

#### NVIDIA GPUs

```bash
# Install CUDA Toolkit from NVIDIA's website first
# https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

# Install PyTorch with CUDA support
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117

# Install CuPy (match with your CUDA version)
pip install cupy-cuda11x  # For CUDA 11.x
```

#### AMD GPUs

```bash
# Install ROCm first, following AMD's instructions
# https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Installation-Guide.html

# Install PyTorch with ROCm support
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.4.2
```

#### CPU-only Fallback

```bash
# CPU-only versions
pip install torch torchvision
pip install cupy
```

### Testing Your Installation

Verify your installation with the test script:

```bash
# Check GPU acceleration
python -m unlook.utils.check_gpu

# Run basic test
python -m unlook.examples.test_client
```

## üìä Example Usage

### Basic Client Connection

```python
from unlook import UnlookClient, EventType

# Create client
client = UnlookClient(client_name="ExampleApp")

# Register callback for events
def on_connected(scanner):
    print(f"Connected to: {scanner.name} ({scanner.uuid})")

client.on(EventType.CONNECTED, on_connected)

# Discover available scanners
client.start_discovery()

# Connect to the first available scanner
scanners = client.get_discovered_scanners()
if scanners:
    client.connect(scanners[0])
    
    # Capture image using structured light module
    image = client.camera.capture("camera_id")
```

### Real-Time Scanning

```python
from unlook import UnlookClient
from unlook.client.realtime_scanner import create_realtime_scanner
import time

# Create client and connect to scanner
client = UnlookClient(auto_discover=True)
client.start_discovery()
time.sleep(5)  # Wait for discovery

scanners = client.get_discovered_scanners()
if scanners:
    client.connect(scanners[0])
    
    # Create real-time scanner with desired quality
    scanner = create_realtime_scanner(
        client=client,
        quality="medium",  # Options: "fast", "medium", "high", "ultra"
        calibration_file="calibration/stereo_calib.json"  # Optional
    )
    
    # Start continuous scanning
    scanner.start()
    
    # Show visualization (press ESC to exit)
    from unlook.client.visualization import ScanVisualizer
    visualizer = ScanVisualizer()
    
    try:
        while True:
            # Get the latest point cloud
            point_cloud = scanner.get_current_point_cloud()
            
            # Update visualization if available
            if point_cloud is not None:
                visualizer.update(
                    point_cloud, 
                    scanner.get_fps(), 
                    scanner.get_scan_count()
                )
                
            time.sleep(0.01)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    finally:
        scanner.stop()
        visualizer.close()
```

### Camera Configuration

```python
from unlook.client.camera_config import CameraConfig, ColorMode, CompressionFormat

# Create a new camera configuration
config = CameraConfig()

# Configure basic settings
config.exposure_time = 20000  # in microseconds (20ms)
config.gain = 1.5
config.jpeg_quality = 90
config.color_mode = ColorMode.COLOR

# Apply configuration to a camera
client.camera.apply_camera_config("camera_1", config)
```

### Pattern Sequences for Structured Light Scanning

```python
# Define a sequence of patterns
patterns = [
    {"pattern_type": "solid_field", "color": "White"},
    {"pattern_type": "horizontal_lines", "foreground_color": "White", 
     "background_color": "Black", "foreground_width": 4, "background_width": 20},
    {"pattern_type": "vertical_lines", "foreground_color": "White", 
     "background_color": "Black", "foreground_width": 4, "background_width": 20},
    {"pattern_type": "grid", "foreground_color": "White", "background_color": "Black"}
]

# Start the sequence with 1s interval, looping
result = client.projector.start_pattern_sequence(
    patterns=patterns,
    interval=1.0,      # 1 second between patterns
    loop=True,         # Loop continuously
    sync_with_camera=True  # Enable projector-camera synchronization
)
```

## üß© Architecture

The SDK is structured into several main modules:

```
unlook/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/              # Core components (events, protocol, discovery)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/            # Client implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/            # Server implementation
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hardware/      # Drivers for specific hardware modules
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/          # Example scripts
```

## üìù Communication Protocol

Communication between client and server happens through structured messages over ZeroMQ:

- **Control channel**: REQ/REP pattern for control commands and configuration
- **Stream channel**: PUB/SUB pattern for standard video streaming
- **Direct channel**: PAIR pattern for low-latency streaming with synchronization

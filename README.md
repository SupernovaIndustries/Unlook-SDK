**Unlook SDK** is a powerful and flexible Python framework designed to control Unlook - a modular open-source 3D scanning system that supports interchangeable optics and sensors, similar to how cameras support different lenses. This SDK provides a complete solution for managing various scanning modules, from structured light systems to depth sensors, point projectors, and more.

## üåü Key Features

- **Modular Hardware Support**: Control multiple scanning technologies through a unified interface
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Clean separation between control clients and acquisition servers
- **Auto-Discovery**: Automatic detection of available Unlook scanners on local network
- **Comprehensive Control**:
  - DLPC342X projector interface for structured light modules
  - Multiple camera support for stereo and multi-view setups
  - Depth sensor integration
  - Point projector management
- **Advanced Video Streaming**:
  - Standard streams for visualization and monitoring
  - **‚ú® NEW! Low-latency direct streams** for real-time applications
  - **‚ú® NEW! Automated pattern sequences** for structured light scanning
  - Precise projector-camera synchronization
- **Optimized Communication**: Efficient image transfer and control using ZeroMQ
- **Easy Expandability**: Modular architecture to add new hardware and algorithms

## üß© Scanning Module Support

Unlook is designed as a modular platform with interchangeable scanning modules, all controlled through this SDK:

| Scanning Module | Technology | Status |
|-----------------|------------|--------|
| Structured Light | Pattern projection & triangulation | ‚úÖ Available |
| Depth Sensor | Time-of-flight or structured light | üîú Coming soon |
| Point Projector | Laser/IR dot pattern | üîú Coming soon |
| Custom Modules | User-created scanning solutions | üìù Supported |

## üîÑ Low-Latency Direct Streaming

The new **direct streaming** feature is designed for applications requiring minimal latency and high responsiveness:

| Feature | Standard Streaming | üöÄ **Direct Streaming** |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Latency | 50-100ms | **5-20ms** |
| Max Framerate | 30 FPS | **60-120 FPS** |
| Sync Precision | 20-50ms | **<10ms** |
| Auto Recovery | ‚úì | ‚úì‚úì (improved) |
| CPU Overhead | Medium | Low |
| ZeroMQ Socket | PUB/SUB | PAIR (optimized) |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Raspberry Pi (for server) with Raspberry Pi OS
- Unlook scanner modules (structured light, depth sensor, etc.)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YourOrganization/unlook.git
cd unlook

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Development installation
pip install -e .
```

### Using as a Client

```python
from unlook import UnlookClient, EventType

# Create client
client = UnlookClient(client_name="ExampleApp")

# Register callback for events
def on_connected(scanner):
    print(f"Connected to: {scanner.name} ({scanner.uuid})")

client.on(EventType.CONNECTED, on_connected)

# Discover available scanners
client.start_discovery()

# Connect to the first available scanner
scanners = client.get_discovered_scanners()
if scanners:
    client.connect(scanners[0])
    
    # Capture image using structured light module
    image = client.camera.capture("camera_id")
    
    # Start low-latency direct streaming
    client.stream.start_direct_stream(
        "camera_id",
        callback=my_frame_callback,
        fps=60,
        low_latency=True,
        sync_with_projector=True
    )
    
    # Create and start a pattern sequence
    patterns = [
        {"pattern_type": "solid_field", "color": "White"},
        {"pattern_type": "horizontal_lines", "foreground_color": "White", 
         "background_color": "Black", "foreground_width": 4, "background_width": 20},
        {"pattern_type": "grid", "foreground_color": "White", "background_color": "Black"}
    ]
    client.projector.start_pattern_sequence(patterns, interval=0.5, loop=True)
```

### Using as a Server

```python
from unlook import UnlookServer

# Start server
server = UnlookServer(
    name="My3DScanner",
    control_port=5555,
    stream_port=5556,
    direct_stream_port=5557,
    auto_start=True
)

# The server will automatically handle client connections and requests
```

## üß© Architecture

The SDK is structured into several main modules:

```
unlook/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/              # Core components (events, protocol, discovery)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/            # Client implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/            # Server implementation
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hardware/      # Drivers for specific hardware modules
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/          # Example scripts
```

## üìù Communication Protocol

Communication between client and server happens through structured messages over ZeroMQ:

- **Control channel**: REQ/REP pattern for control commands and configuration
- **Stream channel**: PUB/SUB pattern for standard video streaming
- **Direct channel**: PAIR pattern for low-latency streaming with synchronization

## üîÑ Module-Specific Features

### Structured Light Module

- Pattern generation and projection
- **Automated pattern sequences** with timing control
- Camera-projector synchronization
- Phase unwrapping and 3D reconstruction

### Depth Sensor Module

- Depth stream acquisition
- Point cloud generation
- Filtering and processing

### Point Projector Module

- Pattern control and calibration
- Feature detection and tracking
- Sparse reconstruction

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization and Extensions

The SDK is designed to be easily extended:

- **New hardware modules**: Add support for your own scanning devices
- **Reconstruction algorithms**: Implement custom 3D scanning algorithms
- **Custom protocols**: Extend the protocol for your specific needs

## üìä Performance Benchmarking

Optimize system performance with built-in benchmarking tools:

```python
# Compare performance
results = client.benchmark.compare_streaming_performance(
    camera_id="camera_id",
    duration_seconds=30,
    modes=["standard", "direct", "direct_sync"]
)

# Export results
client.benchmark.export_results("benchmark_results.json")
```

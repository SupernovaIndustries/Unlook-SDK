## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+ (Python 3.9 or 3.10 recommended)
- Raspberry Pi (for server) with Raspberry Pi OS
- Unlook scanner modules (structured light, depth sensor, etc.)

### Basic Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SupernovaIndustries/unlook.git
cd unlook

# Basic installation with required dependencies
pip install -r client-requirements.txt
```

### Simple Example

```python
from unlook import UnlookClient
import time

# Create client and auto-discover scanners
client = UnlookClient(auto_discover=True)
client.start_discovery()
time.sleep(5)  # Wait for discovery

# Connect to first available scanner
scanners = client.get_discovered_scanners()
if scanners:
    client.connect(scanners[0])
    
    # Capture an image
    image = client.camera.capture("camera_0")
    
    # Perform a 3D scan
    from unlook.client.scanning import StaticScanner
    scanner = StaticScanner(client=client)
    point_cloud = scanner.perform_scan()
    
    # Display the point cloud
    scanner.visualize_point_cloud(point_cloud)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### GPU Acceleration

For optimal performance, we recommend setting up GPU acceleration:

```bash
# Install CUDA Toolkit from NVIDIA's website first
# https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

# Install PyTorch with CUDA support
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

### Advanced Pattern Support

For the advanced pattern types, install additional dependencies:

```bash
# For all pattern types
pip install scipy opencv-contrib-python
```

## üìä Example Projects

Check the `unlook/examples/` directory for comprehensive examples:

- **Basic Examples**: Simple client connections, camera capture, and LED control
- **3D Scanning**: Real-time scanning, static scanning with different pattern types
- **Advanced Features**: Camera calibration, gesture recognition, pattern optimization
- **Integration Tests**: Verify functionality across different components

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The SDK is structured into three main modules:

### Core Module (`unlook.core`)
- Communication protocol definitions
- Service discovery
- Event management system

### Client Module (`unlook.client`)
- Scanner client and connection management
- Camera and projector control
- 3D scanning algorithms
- Pattern generation and processing
- ISO compliance features

### Server Module (`unlook.server`)
- Hardware interfaces
- Device management
- Acquisition and streaming

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated
2. Verify hardware connections and permissions
3. Check for proper dependency installation
4. Enable debug logging for detailed information:
   ```python
   import logging
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
   ```
5. Consult the [Troubleshooting Guide](https://unlook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html)

### Hand Gesture Recognition Models

To use the hand detection and gesture recognition features, you need to download pre-trained models:

1. Download HAGRID models from [https://github.com/hukenovs/hagrid](https://github.com/hukenovs/hagrid/tree/Hagrid_v2-1M?tab=readme-ov-file#train)
2. Place the model files in the `/unlook/client/scanning/handpose/model` directory

The hand gesture recognition is based on code and models from the HAGRID dataset developed by D. Hutsanov et al., as well as 3D hand pose estimation implementations from Temuge Batchuluun. Please cite their work if you use this functionality in your research:

### Simple 3D Scanning Example

```python
from unlook import UnlookClient
from unlook.client.scanner import Scanner3D
from unlook.client.logging_config import setup_logging

# Setup professional logging
setup_logging(level='INFO')

# Auto-discover and connect to scanner
client = UnlookClient(auto_discover=True)
client.start_discovery()

# Connect to scanner
scanners = client.get_discovered_scanners()
if scanners:
    client.connect(scanners[0])
    print(f"Connected to {scanners[0].name}")
    
    # Create 3D scanner with VCSEL IR projector
    scanner = Scanner3D(client, calibration_file="stereo_calibration.json")
    
    # Perform high-quality 3D scan
    result = scanner.scan(quality="high", output_dir="scan_results")
    
    if result.has_point_cloud():
        print(f"Scan complete: {len(result.point_cloud.points)} points")
        
        # Save results in multiple formats
        result.save("./scan_output")
        
        # Display with uncertainty visualization

   .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

2. **Enable Professional Debug Mode**:
   ```python
   from unlook.client.logging_config import debug_mode
   log_file = debug_mode("troubleshooting")
   print(f"Debug logs: {log_file}")
   ```

3. **Check Hardware Status**:
   - Verify VCSEL IR projector is powered and connected
   - Ensure stereo cameras are calibrated and functional
   - Check network connectivity to scanner server

4. **Validate Scan Quality**:
   ```python
   # Run diagnostic scan
   result = scanner.scan(debug_output=True)
   if not result.has_point_cloud():
       print("Check debug_info:", result.debug_info)
   ```

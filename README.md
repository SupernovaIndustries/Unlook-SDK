The new **direct streaming** feature is designed for applications requiring minimal latency and high responsiveness:

| Feature | Standard Streaming | üöÄ **Direct Streaming** |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Latency | 50-100ms | **5-20ms** |
| Max Framerate | 30 FPS | **60-120 FPS** |
| Sync Precision | 20-50ms | **<10ms** |
| Auto Recovery | ‚úì | ‚úì‚úì (improved) |

| ZeroMQ Socket | PUB/SUB | PAIR (optimized) |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Raspberry Pi (for server) with Raspberry Pi OS
- Unlook scanner modules (structured light, depth sensor, etc.)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YourOrganization/unlook.git
cd unlook

# Basic installation with required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For 3D scanning with advanced point cloud processing (recommended)
pip install open3d

# Development installation
pip install -e .
```

### Using as a Client

```python
from unlook import UnlookClient, EventType

# Create client
client = UnlookClient(client_name="ExampleApp")

# Register callback for events
def on_connected(scanner):
    print(f"Connected to: {scanner.name} ({scanner.uuid})")

client.on(EventType.CONNECTED, on_connected)

# Discover available scanners
client.start_discovery()

# Connect to the first available scanner
scanners = client.get_discovered_scanners()
if scanners:
    client.connect(scanners[0])
    
    # Capture image using structured light module
    image = client.camera.capture("camera_id")
    
    # Start low-latency direct streaming
    client.stream.start_direct_stream(
        "camera_id",
        callback=my_frame_callback,
        fps=60,
        low_latency=True,
        sync_with_projector=True
    )
    
    # Create and start a pattern sequence
    patterns = [
        {"pattern_type": "solid_field", "color": "White"},
        {"pattern_type": "horizontal_lines", "foreground_color": "White", 
         "background_color": "Black", "foreground_width": 4, "background_width": 20},
        {"pattern_type": "grid", "foreground_color": "White", "background_color": "Black"}
    ]
    client.projector.start_pattern_sequence(patterns, interval=0.5, loop=True)
```

### Simplified 3D Scanning (Recommended)

```python
from unlook import RobustStructuredLightScanner, ScanConfig

# Set up hardware components
from unlook.client.camera import StereoCamera
from unlook.client.projector import Projector

# Create camera and projector instances
camera = StereoCamera()
projector = Projector()

# Configure scan quality (supported presets: "fast", "medium", "high", "ultra")
config = ScanConfig()
config.quality = "high"  # Balance between quality and speed

# Create scanner with components and configuration
scanner = RobustStructuredLightScanner(
    camera=camera,
    projector=projector,
    config=config
)

# Perform a complete 3D scan
point_cloud = scanner.scan(output_dir="scan_results")

# Create a mesh from the point cloud (requires Open3D)
mesh = scanner.create_mesh(point_cloud)

# Save the results
scanner.save_point_cloud(point_cloud, "scan_results/my_scan.ply")
scanner.save_mesh(mesh, "scan_results/my_scan_mesh.ply")
```

### Camera Calibration

```python
from unlook.client import StereoCalibrator

# Create a calibrator instance
calibrator = StereoCalibrator(
    checkerboard_size=(9, 6),  # inner corners
    square_size=0.025  # in meters
)

# Load calibration images
left_images = [cv2.imread(f"calibration/left/left_{i:02d}.png") for i in range(20)]
right_images = [cv2.imread(f"calibration/right/right_{i:02d}.png") for i in range(20)]

# Run calibration
result = calibrator.calibrate_stereo(left_images, right_images)

# Save calibration parameters
calibrator.save_calibration("calibration_params.json")

# Use with scanner
from unlook import RobustStructuredLightScanner, ScanConfig
from unlook.client.camera import StereoCamera
from unlook.client.projector import Projector

scanner = RobustStructuredLightScanner(
    camera=StereoCamera(),
    projector=Projector(),
    config=ScanConfig(),
    calibration_file="calibration_params.json"
)
```

### Robust 3D Scanning Example

```python
import os
import time
import numpy as np
import cv2
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Import Unlook SDK components
from unlook.client.robust_structured_light import RobustStructuredLightScanner
from unlook.client.scan_config import ScanConfig
from unlook.client.camera import StereoCamera
from unlook.client.projector import Projector

# Create output directory
output_dir = "scan_results"
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Set up hardware
camera = StereoCamera()
projector = Projector()

# Configure scanning parameters
config = ScanConfig()
config.pattern_resolution = (1024, 768)  # Projector resolution
config.num_gray_codes = 10                # Number of Gray code patterns
config.num_phase_shifts = 8               # Number of phase shifts per frequency
config.phase_shift_frequencies = [1, 8, 16]  # Frequencies for phase shifting

# Create robust scanner
scanner = RobustStructuredLightScanner(
    camera=camera,
    projector=projector,
    config=config
)

# Execute scan
point_cloud = scanner.scan(output_dir=output_dir)
print(f"Scan complete: {len(point_cloud.points)} points")

# Create mesh (requires Open3D)
mesh = scanner.create_mesh(point_cloud)
print(f"Mesh created: {len(mesh.triangles)} triangles")

# Save results
pc_path = os.path.join(output_dir, "scan_point_cloud.ply")
mesh_path = os.path.join(output_dir, "scan_mesh.ply")
scanner.save_point_cloud(point_cloud, pc_path)
scanner.save_mesh(mesh, mesh_path)
print(f"Results saved to {output_dir}")
```

### Using as a Server

```python
from unlook import UnlookServer

# Start server
server = UnlookServer(
    name="My3DScanner",
    control_port=5555,
    stream_port=5556,
    direct_stream_port=5557,
    auto_start=True
)

# The server will automatically handle client connections and requests
```

## üß© Architecture

The SDK is structured into several main modules:

```
unlook/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/              # Core components (events, protocol, discovery)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/            # Client implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/            # Server implementation
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hardware/      # Drivers for specific hardware modules
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/          # Example scripts
```

## üìù Communication Protocol

Communication between client and server happens through structured messages over ZeroMQ:

- **Control channel**: REQ/REP pattern for control commands and configuration
- **Stream channel**: PUB/SUB pattern for standard video streaming
- **Direct channel**: PAIR pattern for low-latency streaming with synchronization

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization and Extensions

The SDK is designed to be easily extended:

- **Reconstruction algorithms**: Implement custom 3D scanning algorithms
- **Custom protocols**: Extend the protocol for your specific needs

## üìä Performance Benchmarking

Optimize system performance with built-in benchmarking tools:

```python
# Compare performance
results = client.benchmark.compare_streaming_performance(
    camera_id="camera_id",
    duration_seconds=30,
    modes=["standard", "direct", "direct_sync"]
)

# Export results
client.benchmark.export_results("benchmark_results.json")
```

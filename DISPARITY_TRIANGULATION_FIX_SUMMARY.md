# üîß DISPARITY AND TRIANGULATION FIX SUMMARY

## üéØ PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED

### 1. **Calibration Scaling Issue**
- The Q matrix has incorrect scaling, causing depths to be ~6x too far
- Expected disparity for 30cm object: 232.6 pixels
- Actual disparity measured: ~59.3 pixels (4x lower than expected)
- This causes triangulated depths to be 4-6x farther than reality

### 2. **Disparity Range Issues**
- The stereo matcher was using incorrect focal length estimation
- Disparity search range was not optimal for desktop scanning (20cm-1m)

### 3. **Lack of Debug Visibility**
- No comprehensive logging to diagnose disparity/triangulation issues
- Hard to track where the scaling problem originated

## ‚úÖ FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Advanced Stereo Matcher Improvements** (`advanced_stereo_matcher.py`)
- Added comprehensive debug logging for disparity computation
- Fixed focal length to use known calibration value (877.6 pixels)
- Optimized disparity range for desktop scanning (200mm to 1000mm)
- Added disparity analysis with expected vs actual comparison
- Added input image brightness analysis to detect exposure issues

### 2. **Advanced Triangulator Fixes** (`advanced_triangulator.py`)
- Added automatic Q matrix scaling detection and correction
- Calculates expected Q[2,3] value and compares with actual
- Applies correction factor automatically when scaling issue detected
- Added debug logging for triangulation pipeline stages
- Updated depth validity ranges for desktop scanning (10cm-2m)
- Added warnings when depths are outside expected ranges

### 3. **Reconstruction Module Updates** (`reconstruction_module.py`)
- Replaced simplified stereo with advanced stereo components
- Uses `AdvancedStereoMatcher` and `AdvancedTriangulator`
- Processes more patterns (up to 6) for better coverage
- Added depth reasonableness checks (200-800mm for desktop)
- Improved debug visualizations saved to disk
- Better error handling and reporting

### 4. **Debug Features Added**
- üîç **Disparity Analysis**: Shows min/max/mean disparity values
- üìä **Expected vs Actual**: Compares measured disparity with theoretical
- üéØ **Calibration Check**: Detects and reports Q matrix scaling issues
- üìè **Depth Validation**: Checks if depths are in reasonable range
- üíæ **Debug Output**: Saves disparity maps, colored visualizations

## üöÄ HOW TO USE

### 1. **Test the Fix**
```bash
cd /mnt/g/Supernova/Prototipi/UnLook/Software/Unlook-SDK
.venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
python test_disparity_triangulation_fix.py
```

### 2. **Process Existing Data**
```bash
python unlook/examples/scanning/process_offline.py --input captured_data/20250531_005620 --surface-reconstruction
```

### 3. **Enable Debug Mode**
Set logging to DEBUG level to see all diagnostic information:
```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('unlook').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## üìà EXPECTED RESULTS

### Before Fix:
- Mean depth: ~2360mm (6x too far)
- Disparity: ~59 pixels (4x too low)
- Points outside reasonable range

### After Fix:
- Mean depth: 300-500mm (correct for desktop scanning)
- Disparity: properly scaled
- Points in expected range
- Automatic calibration correction applied

## üîç DEBUG OUTPUT LOCATIONS

When processing, debug files are saved to:
- `captured_data/*/debug_fix_test/` - Test script output
- `captured_data/*/debug_advanced_reconstruction/` - Process offline debug
- `captured_data/*/debug_analysis/` - Calibration analysis

Files include:
- `disparity_map.png` - Raw disparity visualization
- `disparity_colored.png` - Colored disparity map
- `test_report.json` - Complete analysis report
- `test_reconstruction.ply` - 3D point cloud

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Calibration Quality**: The fix detects and corrects systematic calibration errors, but proper calibration is still important
2. **2K Resolution**: The fixes work with both standard and 2K resolution captures
3. **Performance**: Advanced algorithms are slightly slower but produce much better results
4. **Filtering**: Most aggressive filtering is disabled during debugging to see all data

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

1. Run test script to verify fixes work with your data
2. Process all captured sessions with the fixed algorithms
3. If depths are still incorrect, check the calibration file
4. Consider recalibrating with known-distance targets for validation

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

If depths are still incorrect after applying fixes:
1. Check debug output for calibration scale factor
2. Verify focal length matches your camera (should be ~877 pixels for standard setup)
3. Ensure baseline is correct (should be 79.5mm for standard setup)
4. Look for exposure differences between left/right cameras
5. Check if images are properly rectified

# Unlook SDK Console

## Concept Overview

The Unlook SDK Console is a unified environment for working with the Unlook SDK, providing a consistent developer experience across different platforms. The console automatically sets up and manages all required dependencies, including CUDA, Open3D, and other GPU-accelerated libraries.

## Key Features

1. **Preconfigured Environment**
   - Managed Python virtual environment with all dependencies installed
   - Pre-configured CUDA and GPU support
   - Consistent paths and environment variables

2. **Cross-Platform Support**
   - Windows: Native executable installer
   - Linux: Installation script with interactive setup
   - macOS: Installation package with automatic configuration

3. **Command-Line Interface**
   - Direct access to SDK tools and utilities
   - Built-in help and documentation
   - Terminal with syntax highlighting for Python

4. **Quick-Start Templates**
   - Pre-built examples for common use cases
   - Template projects for scanner integration
   - Wizard for creating new SDK projects

## Implementation Plan

### Windows Implementation

1. **Installer Package**
   - Windows executable (.exe) installer
   - Bundled Python interpreter (no system Python dependency)
   - CUDA runtime components included

2. **Environment Management**
   - Virtual environment created in user's AppData folder
   - Context menu integration for launching SDK Console
   - Desktop and Start Menu shortcuts

3. **Console Application**
   - Custom terminal with SDK tools in PATH
   - Auto-complete for SDK commands
   - Built-in diagnostic tools

### Linux Implementation

1. **Installation Script**
   - Bash script for interactive installation
   - Dependency checking and installation
   - User and system-level installation options

2. **Environment Management**
   - Virtual environment in user's home directory
   - Shell integration for environment activation
   - Automatic CUDA and GPU library setup

3. **Console Application**
   - Terminal wrapper with environment activation
   - Command completion for bash/zsh
   - Integration with system package manager for updates

### macOS Implementation

1. **Installation Package**
   - DMG package for drag-and-drop installation
   - Homebrew integration for dependency management
   - Applications folder integration

2. **Environment Management**
   - Virtual environment in user's Application Support folder
   - Automatic PATH configuration
   - Environment variables in user profile

3. **Console Application**
   - Custom terminal app with SDK branding
   - Integration with macOS terminal
   - Spotlight integration for quick launch

## User Experience

### Installation Flow

1. User downloads platform-specific installer
2. Installer checks for prerequisites (admin rights, disk space)
3. User selects installation options (location, components)
4. Installer downloads and configures dependencies
5. Environment is set up and SDK Console is registered
6. Quick-start guide is displayed at completion

### Daily Usage

1. User launches "Unlook SDK Console" from desktop/start menu
2. Console opens with environment already activated
3. SDK tools and commands are immediately available
4. User can run examples, develop code, or use diagnostic tools
5. Built-in help command provides documentation access

## Technical Architecture

### Environment Components

1. **Core Components**
   - Python interpreter (embedded/isolated)
   - Virtual environment with SDK packages
   - CUDA runtime components

2. **Package Management**
   - Custom package index for SDK components
   - Dependency resolution with pip/conda
   - Version locking for stability

3. **SDK Integration**
   - Auto-discovery of scanners
   - Pre-configured paths for data storage
   - Logging and diagnostics framework

### Configuration System

1. **User Configuration**
   - Settings stored in user profile
   - Hardware configuration profiles
   - Development environment preferences

2. **System Integration**
   - PATH and environment variable management
   - File associations for SDK file types
   - SDK update notification system

## Future Expansion

1. **GUI Components**
   - Scanner configuration wizard
   - Real-time visualization tools
   - Scan data management interface

2. **Development Tools**
   - SDK project templates
   - Code generation for common tasks
   - Integrated debugging tools

3. **Cloud Integration**
   - Scan data backup and sync
   - Model repository integration
   - Remote processing capabilities

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Phase 1: Core Environment**
   - Basic installation packages for all platforms
   - Environment setup and dependency management
   - Command-line console with SDK tools

2. **Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience**
   - Improved installation flow
   - Quick-start templates and examples
   - Basic GUI components

3. **Phase 3: Full Feature Set**
   - Complete GUI interface
   - Advanced development tools
   - Cloud integration features

## Technical Notes

- Python virtual environments will use venv or conda based on platform
- CUDA setup will automatically detect and configure GPU capabilities
- SDK Console will maintain backward compatibility with existing scripts
- Installation size target: <500MB including core dependencies
